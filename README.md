# Faulty system
This branch holds the complete application (with the telemetry capture structure in place) with the Violation of the Event Carried State Transfer included (see in the [`reserve/app`](https://github.com/Bjastkuliar/ecst-violation/blob/ce470a0c343946fc4edc3dcfe0ef3ae84522c21a/reserve/app.py#L191-L197)). 

The deployment instructions are the same in the [`README.md` of the main branch](https://github.com/Bjastkuliar/ecst-violation?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-run).
